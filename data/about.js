        <p>
          Fozzini Lifestyle Concepts, Inc. had its humble beginnings in the
          1960’s as a simple woodworking workshop located in Binondo, Manila. At
          the time, the company had only been crafting wooden chests and boxes
          for a myriad of consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the 1970’s, the company grew large enough to relocate to the
          industrial area of Valenzuala, and had expanded its production line to
          include different types of home furniture such as dining tables and
          chairs. During this time the company restructured under the name of
          Everwood Products Manufacturing, Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1980’s the business was acquired by a group of entrepreneurs
          and rebranded to Jowbiwood Products Manufacturing, Inc. while
          maintaining Everwood as its brand name for the company’s furniture
          line.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1990’s, the business had grown to include the manufacturing of
          steel furniture, modular cabinetry, and a myriad of upholstery
          products. It was during this successful period that the company was
          able to expand and reach a nationwide market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering a new millennium meant entering a new era for the company,
          and by the late 2000’s the company finally rebranded to Fozzini
          Lifestyle Concepts, Inc. To this day, the company continues to
          manufacture and supply high caliber furniture and modular cabinetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Fozzini Lifestyle Concepts, Inc., we guarantee that you can live
          in comfort.
